Sure, let's create a README file to explain the purpose of the code and how to use it.

# History Buffer Manager

The **HistoryBufferManager** is a Python class that manages a history buffer for debugging purposes. It is designed to keep track of the history of a pipeline by storing and managing DebugTuples and related DebugSteps.

## Usage

### Importing the Module

```python
from typing import Optional, Dict, List
from utils.debugStep import DebugStep
from utils.debugTuple import DebugTuple
```

### Initializing HistoryBufferManager

```python
debugger = PipelineDebugger()
history_buffer_manager = HistoryBufferManager(debugger)
```

### Memory Limits

Set the memory limits for main memory and storage memory:

```python
history_buffer_manager.changeMemoryLimit(mainMemorySize: Optional[int], storageMemorySize: Optional[int])
```

### Registering Steps

Register a step in the history buffer:

```python
step = DebugStep(time.time(), dt, lastDT)
history_buffer_manager.registerStep(step)
```

### Resetting the Buffer

Reset the history buffer:

```python
history_buffer_manager.reset()
```

### Getting Memory Sizes

Get the current memory sizes for main memory and storage memory:

```python
main_memory_size = history_buffer_manager.getMainMemorySize()
storage_memory_size = history_buffer_manager.getStorageMemorySize()
```

### Loading DebugTuples

Load a DebugTuple from storage:

```python
dt = DebugTuple(Tuple((_getRandomData(),)))
history_buffer_manager.requestDT(dt)
```

## Test Script (test.py)

A test script is provided (test.py) that demonstrates the usage of the **HistoryBufferManager**. It generates random data, creates DebugSteps, and registers them in the history buffer.

## Dependencies

The code has dependencies on external modules such as `numpy` and custom utility classes (`CustomClass`, `DebugStep`, `DebugTuple`, `PipelineDebugger`, and `Tuple`). Ensure these modules are installed before running the code.

## Running the Test

To run the provided test script (test.py), execute the following command:

```bash
python test.py
```

## Notes

- Ensure that the required dependencies are installed.
- Adjust the memory limits according to your application requirements.
- Review the provided comments in the code for additional details.
